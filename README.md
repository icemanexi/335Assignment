# 335Assignment
matlab code for a mathematics and engineering assignment

This is the matlab code for a final assignment in my third year of math/eng. 

The assignment has us analyze down sampling methods for signals, use low pass filters to remove noise from a signal, and approximate a signal using polynomials.

For reference, a signal is just a function over time, it could be explicitly defined: sin(x) or x^2 - 2x + 1 over some period of time, or it might just be a random sampling of points over time (eg water level at a point after you drop something in).
