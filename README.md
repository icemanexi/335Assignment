matlab code for a mathematics and engineering assignment

This is the matlab code for a final assignment in my third year of math/eng. 

The assignment has us analyze down sampling methods for signals, use low pass filters to remove noise from a signal, approximate a signal using polynomials.

For reference, a signal is just a function, eg sin(x) or x^2 - 2x + 1
